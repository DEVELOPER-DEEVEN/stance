# Stance

**Premium Decision-Advocacy Intelligence**

Stance is a native Apple-platform application (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) designed to construct the strongest logically defensible, data-backed case for any user position. It is not a neutral analyst; it is an algorithmic advocate.

## Product Definition
Stance accepts a user's claim or decision position and executes a deterministic reasoning pipeline to:
1.  **Reframe** the evaluation criteria to favor the stance.
2.  **Expand** parameter space to find supportive dimensions.
3.  **Discover** patterns, trends, and correlations (including proxies).
4.  **Weight** evidence to maximize advocacy strength.
5.  **Synthesize** a professional, consulting-grade PDF strategy report.

## Platforms
- **iOS:** Mobile command center for quick stance capture and summary review.
- **iPadOS:** Deep-dive analysis and report editing.
- **macOS:** Full studio experience for complex data ingestion and PDF production.

## Core Directive
**"Advocate. Always."**
We do not say "insufficient data." We say "conditional validity under specific scopes."
We do not say "false." We say "contextually dependent."

## Architecture
Built on Swift & SwiftUI.
- **UI:** Shared SwiftUI Design System (Premium, Minimal, SVG-based).
- **Core:** `StanceEngine` (Reasoning Pipeline).
- **Persistence:** SwiftData / CoreData.
- **Output:** PDFKit with Vector Graphics.
